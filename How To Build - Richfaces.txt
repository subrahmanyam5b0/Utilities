Build / Deploy

Deploying on Tomcat

To build the project for Tomcat you need to navigate to the /examples/richfaces-showcase and run:

mvn clean package
When you see the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message you can deploy the application on the server. To deploy it on Tomcat, copy the .war file from target folder to TOMCAT_HOME/webapps folder. Then, launch the startup.sh or startup.bat script from TOMCAT_HOME/bin/ directory to start the server.

Deploying on JBoss AS 7 / EAP 6

To build the project for a JEE6 server you need to navigate to the /examples/richfaces-showcase and run

for JBoss AS 7.0.x:

mvn clean package -Pjbas7
or for JBoss AS 7.1.x / EAP 6

mvn clean package -Pjbas71
When you see the BUILD SUCCESSFUL message you can deploy the application on the server.

First, make sure the application server is running. To start the server: launch the standalone.sh or standalone.bat script from JBOSS_HOME/bin/ together with parameter --server-config=standalone-full.xml for both latest JBoss AS 7.1.x and for latest JBoss AS 7.0.x.

As of JBoss AS 7.1 / EAP 6 you must create the JMS user account/password to enable the JMS push sample. Add a new user to the ApplicationRealm with the $JBOSS_HOME/bin/add-user.bat or add-user.sh script, with the:

        username: guest
        password: p@ssw0rd (for JBoss AS 7.0.x, use "password")
            role: guest
To deploy it on the application server, use either:

Use the jboss-as-maven-plugin to deploy to a running application server:

mvn jboss-as:deploy -Pjbas7

or use the server's management console, which is bound by default at http://localhost:9990

or copy the .war file from target folder to the folder: JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments

After deploying the examples to your server open a browser and type http://localhost:8080/showcase to view the examples. Note that the URL depends on the context on which your application server deployed the showcase application.

Setting up Eclipse to work with the showcase

In order to explore, run and deploy the Showcase using Eclipse IDE you can use one of the following options:

You could use JBoss Tools with m2eclipse plugin and just import the examples as maven-based projects.
Open Eclipse and go to File > Import
Expand the project type named Maven and select Import Maven Project
Browse the directory in which you placed the examples, select it and press OK.
Press next on the import wizard to finish importing the examples.
You are now able to work with the Showcase within Eclipse. Note that by using JBoss Developer Studio you can skip installing all of the required plugins and you can import the project right away.

In order to deploy the Showcase on JBoss AS 7.1.x from Eclipse one needs to:
Select the right maven profile: jbas71
Either by pressing hot key CTRL + ALT + P, while the showcase project is selected
Or right click on the showcase project in the project explorer --> Properties --> Maven and fill in the input: jbas71
Alter the deployment assembly
Right click on the showcase project --> Properties --> Deployment assembly. By default there should be: src/main/java, src/main/resources, src/main/resources-jbas71/, src/main/webapp
One needs to add src/main/webapp-jbas71: hit the add button and select the folder option, find the webapp-jbas71 and add it
Now the showcase can be deployed, be sure that you are loading the showcase application on the correct context root and also that there was not added a default persistence.xml in src/main/resources/META-INF (delete it). The URL one should access looks like: http://localhost:8080/showcase

Mobile compatibility
This showcase is also mobile compatible with WebKit based browsers; this includes iOS, Android, and Others. After you deploy the showcase, just browse to the default context path (for example, http://localhost:8080/showcase) with a mobile iOS or Android based device.

You will see the showcase has been modified to fit and dynamically adjust to mobile screen widths and orientations.

We removed some components from the RichFaces Mobile Showcase which were not mobile ready. For example, rich:tooltip, rich:extendedDataTable, rich:jquery, and rich:popupPanel either did not make sense in a mobile environment or needed a heavy rewrite for touch interfaces.

rich:dragDrop however, does work on iOS Mobile Safari, but not on Android. To use rich:dragDrop in Mobile Safari browsers, you can include this snippet of JavaScript at the bottom of your JSF template.
