# Example INIT.ORA file
#
# This file is provided by Oracle Corporation to help you customize
# your RDBMS installation for your site.  Important system parameters
# are discussed, and example settings given.
#
# Some parameter settings are generic to any size installation.
# For parameters that require different values in different size
# installations, three scenarios have been provided: SMALL, MEDIUM
# and LARGE.  Any parameter that needs to be tuned according to 
# installation size will have three settings, each one commented
# according to installation size.
#
# Use the following table to approximate the SGA size needed for the 
# three scenarious provided in this file:
#
#                     -------Installation/Database Size------
#                      SMALL           MEDIUM           LARGE
#  Block         2K    4500K            6800K           17000K
#  Size          4K    5500K            8800K           21000K
#
# To set up a database that multiple instances will be using, place
# all instance-specific parameters in one file, and then have all
# of these files point to a master file using the IFILE command.
# This way, when you change a public
# parameter, it will automatically change on all instances.  This is 
# necessary, since all instances must run with the same value for many
# parameters. For example, if you choose to use private rollback segments, 
# these must be specified in different files, but since all gc_* 
# parameters must be the same on all instances, they should be in one file.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS: Edit this file and the other INIT files it calls for
# your site, either by using the values provided here or by providing
# your own.  Then place an IFILE= line into each instance-specific
# INIT file that points at this file.
#
# NOTE: Parameter values suggested in this file are based on conservative
# estimates for computer memory availability. You should adjust values upward
# for modern machines.
#
# You may also consider using Database Configuration Assistant tool (DBCA)
# to create INIT file and to size your initial set of tablespaces based
# on the user input.
